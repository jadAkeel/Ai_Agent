# Global Codex Instructions

## Default Engineering Rules

- Inspect real files and command output before making claims or edits.
- Keep changes minimal, focused, and directly tied to the task.
- Do not do unrelated refactors, cleanup, rewrites, or formatting churn.
- Follow existing architecture, naming, formatting, conventions, and patterns.
- Preserve existing behavior unless the user explicitly asks for a behavior change.
- Do not introduce dependencies unless clearly necessary and justified.
- Do not silently change public APIs, data contracts, or user-visible behavior.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes when appropriate, matching existing test style.
- Never delete, weaken, skip, or fake tests just to make checks pass.
- Never invent command results, tests, files changed, branch names, or repo state.
- Summarize unknowns and assumptions clearly.
- Before finishing, summarize files changed, commands run, results, and remaining risks.

## Global Skills

Skills live in `~/.codex/skills` and should be used when helpful, not for tiny obvious edits.

- `repo-onboarding`: analyze a repository, identify stack, structure, commands, risks, conventions, and next steps.
- `implementation-planner`: plan significant changes before editing, including assumptions, risks, files, and tests.
- `bug-investigator`: investigate failures, logs, stack traces, and broken behavior before fixing.
- `safe-implementation`: make focused code changes that follow existing patterns and preserve behavior.
- `test-and-verification`: identify and run meaningful checks, add tests when appropriate, and report evidence.
- `senior-code-reviewer`: review diffs for correctness, regressions, edge cases, tests, security, performance, and maintainability.
- `security-reviewer`: review auth, authorization, APIs, uploads, payments, admin, user data, secrets, validation, and dependency risks.
- `docs-updater`: update or recommend concise docs for behavior, setup, config, API, command, env, or migration changes.
- `pr-and-commit-writer`: write commit messages and PR descriptions from the actual diff without inventing tests.
- `codex-handoff`: create a handoff summary and ready-to-paste next-session prompt.

## Trigger Phrases

- Use `repo-onboarding` for: "Analyze this repo", "Understand this project", "Onboard to this codebase", "Create a project map".
- Use `implementation-planner` for: "Plan this change", "Before editing, create a plan", "How should we implement this?", "Analyze the task first".
- Use `bug-investigator` for: "Investigate this bug", "Find the root cause", "Why is this failing?", "Debug this issue".
- Use `safe-implementation` for: "Implement this", "Apply the plan", "Make the change", "Fix it safely".
- Use `test-and-verification` for: "Verify this change", "Run tests", "Create a test plan", "How do we know this works?".
- Use `senior-code-reviewer` for: "Review this diff", "Act as senior reviewer", "Check my changes", "Is this safe?".
- Use `security-reviewer` for: "Security review this", "Check auth risks", "Review this API for vulnerabilities", "Is this safe for production?".
- Use `docs-updater` for: "Update docs", "Does this need README changes?", "Document this feature", "Add setup instructions".
- Use `pr-and-commit-writer` for: "Write a PR description", "Create commit message", "Summarize this diff", "Prepare this for review".
- Use `codex-handoff` for: "Create handoff", "Make a handoff summary", "Prepare next session", "Summarize for another agent".

## Default Workflow

1. Use `repo-onboarding` when starting in an unfamiliar project.
2. Use `implementation-planner` before significant edits.
3. Use `bug-investigator` for bugs, failing tests, logs, or runtime errors.
4. Use `safe-implementation` for focused changes.
5. Use `test-and-verification` before claiming completion.
6. Use `senior-code-reviewer` after implementation when the diff is non-trivial.
7. Use `security-reviewer` for auth, API, payment, upload, admin, user-data, permission, secret, or validation-sensitive work.
8. Use `docs-updater` when behavior, setup, config, API, commands, env vars, or migrations change.
9. Use `pr-and-commit-writer` when preparing commits or PRs.
10. Use `codex-handoff` before ending a long session or moving work to a new session.
